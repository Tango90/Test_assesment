I have design and implement the solution for the giving scenario. Let's break it down into parts: 
database schema, 
data insertion script, and APIs, 

Notes

•	The APIs assume FastAPI and psycopg2. Install dependencies: pip install fastapi uvicorn psycopg2-binary pydantic.
•	Run APIs with uvicorn main:app --reload.
•	The script and APIs are designed for clarity and functionality. For production, add error handling, logging, and connection pooling.
